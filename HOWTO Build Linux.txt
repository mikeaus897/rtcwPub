Requires GCC and 32 bit libraries. Compile using OS that the Wolf server will run on is recommemnded.

Navigate to: src/unix folder
type: make server
wolfded.x86 should be created in src/unix folder

Navigate to: src/game folder
type: make
qagame.mp.i386.so should be created in src/game folder

The client isn't buildable in Linux, unless you make it buildable.. but good luck!
